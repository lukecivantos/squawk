Welcome to Squawk!
By Luke Civantos, Max Benegas, and Chris Fenaroli

Our website can be found at www.harvardsquawk.co.

On our homepage, feel free to sign up for an account (although the site only
accepts Harvard College email adresses!). The page will ask you to confirm your
email address with a four-digit code sent to your email.

Once logged on, add a post! Write into the text box and hit enter to submit.
Anything you write is completely anonymous, but the site will be monitored for 
inappopriate content. Write anything you'd like to share with the Harvard
community.

You can sort the feed by the time they were posted or the amount of votes they 
have by using the new and popular buttons. You can log out by clicking the red
"log out" button below them. The main table displays the time of the post, the
content, the number of comments, and the number of upvotes with buttons on either
side. 

You can click the smiley face to upvote, or the sad face to downvote. Clicking
the number of comments brings you to a comment page which displays all the
comments for that particular entry. You can upvote and downvote comments as well.
Clicking the Squawk logo will bring you back to the main page.

If you would like to report something, scroll to the bottom of the page and
click the "Report Offensive Content" link and send an email to us.

Thanks for using Squawk!
